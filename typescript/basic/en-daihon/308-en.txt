Shikoku Metan「Let's learn about automatic insertion of undefined!」
Zundamon「When optional parameters are omitted, they automatically become undefined!」
Shikoku Metan「That's right. When arguments aren't passed to a function, their values are treated as undefined.」
Zundamon「Functions without return statements also implicitly return undefined, right?」
Shikoku Metan「Exactly. If there's no explicit return, undefined is returned.」
Zundamon「Optional properties are also automatically undefined when omitted!」
Shikoku Metan「TypeScript has many situations where undefined is auto-inserted, so understanding this is important.」
Zundamon「Using the nullish coalescing operator ?? to set default values is safe!」
