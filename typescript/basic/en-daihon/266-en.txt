Shikoku Metan「Let's learn about truthy values!」
Zundamon「So in JavaScript, there are values that are treated as true even though they're not actually true!」
Shikoku Metan「That's right. Numbers like 1, non-empty strings, arrays, and objects are truthy.」
Zundamon「0 and empty strings are false, but the string '0' becomes true?」
Shikoku Metan「Exactly. If it contains a string, it's judged as truthy.」
Zundamon「It's surprising that empty arrays [] and empty objects {} are also truthy!」
Shikoku Metan「It's commonly used when checking the existence of values in conditional branches, so let's remember it.」
Zundamon「Using the Boolean() function, we can convert any value to true or false!」
