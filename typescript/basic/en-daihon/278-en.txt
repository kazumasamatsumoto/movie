Shikoku Metan「Let's learn about handling the string "true"!」
Zundamon「Even if we get the string "true" from an API, it's different from a boolean!」
Shikoku Metan「That's right. value === true compares a string with a boolean, so it's false.」
Zundamon「if (value) becomes true, but this is unintended behavior, right?」
Shikoku Metan「Exactly. Since strings are truthy, even "false" becomes true.」
Zundamon「We explicitly convert with const boolValue = value === "true"!」
Shikoku Metan「Yes. This makes it work correctly as a boolean.」
Zundamon「It's important to always convert API string values before using them!」
