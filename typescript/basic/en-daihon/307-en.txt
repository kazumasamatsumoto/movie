Shikoku Metan「Let's learn about the JSON representation of undefined!」
Zundamon「In JSON, undefined properties are completely omitted!」
Shikoku Metan「That's right. null remains as '{"value":null}', but undefined disappears.」
Zundamon「undefined in arrays is special - it gets converted to null, right?」
Shikoku Metan「Exactly. In arrays, it's treated as null to preserve the position.」
Zundamon「When optional properties are omitted, they're not included in JSON either!」
Shikoku Metan「Understanding JSON.stringify behavior helps prevent issues during data transmission.」
Zundamon「The difference between undefined and null becomes clear through JSON conversion!」
