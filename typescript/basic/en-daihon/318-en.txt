Shikoku Metan「Let's learn about improved type safety with strictNullChecks!」
Zundamon「With type guards for null checks, we can narrow down to string type!」
Shikoku Metan「That's right. After excluding null in an if statement, it's treated as a string type.」
Zundamon「Control flow analysis automatically narrows the type by TypeScript, right?」
Shikoku Metan「Exactly. After return or throw, the type is narrowed to non-null.」
Zundamon「Optional chaining ?. is also convenient to use!」
Shikoku Metan「Yes. user?.name safely handles null or undefined.」
Zundamon「With type guards and control flow analysis, we can write null-safe code!」
