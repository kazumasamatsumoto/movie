Shikoku Metan「Let's learn about problems caused by confusion with truthy values!」
Zundamon「With if (count), 0 is also falsy, which causes problems!」
Shikoku Metan「That's right. Even though 0 is a valid value for number type, it gets treated as false.」
Zundamon「With count !== null && count !== undefined, 0 is processed correctly, right?」
Shikoku Metan「Exactly. Let's make our intentions clear with explicit checks.」
Zundamon「There's also the count != null notation, but that's exceptional!」
Shikoku Metan「Yes. Use it only when checking for both null and undefined.」
Zundamon「When 0 or empty strings are valid values, always check explicitly!」
