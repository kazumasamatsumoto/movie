Shikoku Metan「Because it shares the same symbol, the ! operator is often confused with logical NOT.」
Zundamon「So const result1 = !value and value! do totally different things, huh?」
Shikoku Metan「Exactly—the former flips a boolean while the latter removes nullish types.」
Zundamon「Writing something like if (!user!) would be nonsense?」
Shikoku Metan「Yes, it becomes unreadable and may even be a syntax error.」
Zundamon「When I need clarity I should compare explicitly with user === null?」
Shikoku Metan「Right, and for truthy checks just evaluate user alone without the assertion.」
Zundamon「Keeping their roles separate helps me avoid typos!」
