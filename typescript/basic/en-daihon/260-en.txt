Shikoku Metan「Yes. We can discriminate types by the existence of specific properties.」
Zundamon「Like using 'bark' in animal?」

Zundamon「Distinguishing success and failure with success: true is common too!」
Shikoku Metan「Yes. Patterns that discriminate types with discriminator properties are practical.」
Zundamon「It's useful for complex type discrimination and allows type-safe code!」
