Shikoku Metan「Let's learn about null/undefined checks!」
Zundamon「I want to know how to check strictly!」
Shikoku Metan「Yes. Using === to check individually is the basic approach.」
Zundamon「We check null and undefined separately!」
Shikoku Metan「Exactly. Each has a different meaning, so distinction is important.」
Zundamon「Is there a way to check both together?」
Shikoku Metan「Yes. Using != null excludes both null and undefined.」
Zundamon「Using them appropriately depending on the situation is important!」
