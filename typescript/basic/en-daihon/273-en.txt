Shikoku Metan「Let's learn about the [disabled] attribute!」
Zundamon「We can disable buttons and inputs with property binding!」
Shikoku Metan「That's right. We can control dynamically based on boolean property values.」
Zundamon「During submission, it's good to disable the button with [disabled]="isSubmitting", right?」
Shikoku Metan「Exactly. It prevents users from double-submitting.」
Zundamon「We can also express non-editable states with [disabled]="!isEditable"!」
Shikoku Metan「By using square brackets [], it links with TypeScript properties.」
Zundamon「It's even more practical when combined with form validation!」
