Shikoku Metan「void shines whenever a function's goal is side effects.」
Zundamon「log(message: string): void is the classic logging helper!」
Shikoku Metan「Exactly; it finishes work without producing a value.」
Zundamon「Do arrow-based event handlers also use void?」
Shikoku Metan「Yes, writing () => void for button.addEventListener keeps intent clear.」
Zundamon「Async functions that resolve to Promise<void> exist too, right?」
Shikoku Metan「They do—saveData just persists data and resolves with nothing.」
Zundamon「I'll pick void whenever side effects are the final goal!」
