Shikoku Metan「Let's review and summarize type guards!」
Zundamon「There were various type guard methods!」
Shikoku Metan「Yes. typeof is for primitive types, instanceof is for classes.」
Zundamon「in is for object properties, and Array.isArray is for arrays!」
Shikoku Metan「Exactly. It's important to use each appropriately in the right situations.」
Zundamon「We can also create custom type guards using type predicate functions!」
Shikoku Metan「Yes. Type predicate functions are useful for complex type checks.」
Zundamon「Now we can write type-safe TypeScript code!」
