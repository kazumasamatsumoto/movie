Shikoku Metan「Let's learn about strictNullChecks support for legacy code!」
Zundamon「Non-Null Assertion ! can be used as a temporary measure!」
Shikoku Metan「That's right. Use it when you can guarantee it's not null/undefined.」
Zundamon「Type assertion as is also convenient as a temporary measure, right?」
Shikoku Metan「Exactly. However, add TODO comments to fix it later.」
Zundamon「Functions with any type should also be fixed gradually!」
Shikoku Metan「Yes. Leave TODOs in legacy parts, and write new code strictly.」
Zundamon「While using temporary workarounds, we improve gradually!」
