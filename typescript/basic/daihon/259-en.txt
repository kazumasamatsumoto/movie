Shikoku Metan「Let's learn about instanceof type guards!」
Zundamon「instanceof checks if something is an instance of a class, right!」
Shikoku Metan「Yes. It works with built-in classes like Date and Error, as well as custom classes.」
Zundamon「Can we check with value instanceof Date?」
Shikoku Metan「Exactly. The type is narrowed and Date-specific methods become available.」
Zundamon「Can we check multiple classes too?」
Shikoku Metan「Yes. Distinguishing between User and Admin classes is a common use case.」
Zundamon「Class-based type checking allows us to write more flexible code!」
