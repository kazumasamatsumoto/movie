Zundamon「So with >, we can check if the left side is greater than the right side!」
Shikoku Metan「That's right. While numeric comparison is the basic use, it also works with strings and Date objects.」
Zundamon「10 > 5 is true, but 5 > 5 becomes false, right?」
Shikoku Metan「Exactly. For equal cases, use the greater than or equal operator >=.」
Zundamon「Creating type-safe comparison functions makes code more readable too!」
Shikoku Metan「It's commonly used in conditional branches like age checks, so let's master it thoroughly.」
Zundamon「It's convenient that strings can also be compared in dictionary order, not just numbers!」
