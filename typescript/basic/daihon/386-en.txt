Shikoku Metan「Let's outline functions that lack return values.」
Zundamon「greet has no return statement, so it's treated as void.」
Shikoku Metan「Yes, assigning its result gives you undefined at runtime.」
Zundamon「Should updateCounter, which only mutates state, also be void?」
Shikoku Metan「Exactly—its sole job is side effects.」
Zundamon「Knowing the runtime result is undefined makes things clear!」
Shikoku Metan「Remember: void in the type system corresponds to undefined at runtime.」
Zundamon「I'll write void functions with that behavior in mind!」
