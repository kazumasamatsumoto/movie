Shikoku Metan「Let's learn about the *ngIf directive!」
Zundamon「We can toggle element visibility based on conditions!」
Shikoku Metan「That's right. Elements are displayed only when the boolean value is true.」
Zundamon「With the else clause, we can also set what to display when the condition is false, right?」
Shikoku Metan「Exactly. Combined with ng-template, it allows flexible control.」
Zundamon「Since DOM elements themselves are added or removed, it's good for performance too!」
Shikoku Metan「Unlike CSS display:none, the important point is that elements are completely removed.」
Zundamon「There are many practical scenarios like UI switching based on login status!」
