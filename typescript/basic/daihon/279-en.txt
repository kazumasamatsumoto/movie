Shikoku Metan「Let's learn about best practices for boolean types!」
Zundamon「First, we must always use the strict equality operator ===!」
Shikoku Metan「That's right. We check types clearly, like value === null.」
Zundamon「Using type guards can further enhance type safety, right?」
Shikoku Metan「Exactly. We can narrow down types with typeof val === 'string'.」
Zundamon「Explicit type annotations like const isActive: boolean are important too!」
Shikoku Metan「Yes. strictNullChecks and ESLint configuration are also essential.」
Zundamon「We prohibit == with "eqeqeq": ["error", "always"]!」
