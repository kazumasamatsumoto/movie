Shikoku Metan「Let's learn about null and undefined comparison!」
Zundamon「These two are similar but different, right?」
Shikoku Metan「Yes. They're considered equal with ==, but different with ===.」
Zundamon「Does null == undefined return true?」
Shikoku Metan「Exactly. However, null === undefined returns false.」
Zundamon「We should use === when we want strict comparison!」
Shikoku Metan「Yes. Using type predicate functions makes it even more type-safe.」
Zundamon「Explicitly checking with isNull or isUndefined functions is better!」
