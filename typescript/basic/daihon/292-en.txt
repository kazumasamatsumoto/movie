Shikoku Metan「Let's learn about the differences between null and empty string!」
Zundamon「'' and null look the same, don't they?」
Shikoku Metan「No. null is null type, '' is string type - they have different types.」
Zundamon「null === '' is false!」
Shikoku Metan「Exactly. They behave differently with Nullish Coalescing too.」
Zundamon「Empty string doesn't get replaced by ?? because it's a valid string?」
Shikoku Metan「Yes. null ?? "Guest" is "Guest", but "" ?? "Guest" is "".」
Zundamon「It's important to handle them type-safely with Union types!」
