Shikoku Metan「Let's learn about the difference between undefined and void!」
Zundamon「So the void type indicates that return values are not used!」
Shikoku Metan「That's right. The undefined type is used when explicitly returning undefined.」
Zundamon「Even functions that return void actually return undefined, right?」
Shikoku Metan「Exactly. void shows the intention at the type level that the return value won't be used.」
Zundamon「The undefined type can be used in union types to express cases where values don't exist!」
Shikoku Metan「By distinguishing them in function return types, the code's intention becomes clear.」
Zundamon「void is for functions with side effects, while undefined type is for functions that might return values!」
