Shikoku Metan「Let's learn about the problems with the == operator!」
Zundamon「Since == does type conversion, it causes unexpected behavior!」
Shikoku Metan「That's right. With userInput == 0, even '0' or empty strings become true.」
Zundamon「value == null is ambiguous because it doesn't distinguish between null and undefined, right?」
Shikoku Metan「Exactly. Always use === for strict comparison.」
Zundamon「With userInput === 0, only the numeric 0 becomes true!」
Shikoku Metan「value === null can strictly check only for null, making it safe.」
Zundamon「To write type-safe code, we must absolutely avoid ==!」
