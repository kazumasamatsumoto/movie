Shikoku Metan「The ! operator removes nullish types at the type level.」
Zundamon「So the type becomes value!: string, right?」
Shikoku Metan「Yes, it only affects TypeScript and leaves no trace in JavaScript.」
Zundamon「Meaning that after transpilation it's just a normal access?」
Shikoku Metan「Exactly—value!.length becomes value.length.」
Zundamon「Can I collapse number | null | undefined down to number the same way?」
Shikoku Metan「Yes, writing data! * 2 treats it as number immediately.」
Zundamon「So it's purely a type conversion with zero runtime safety!」
