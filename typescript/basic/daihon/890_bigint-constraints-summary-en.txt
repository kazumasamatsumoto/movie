#890 "Constraints Recap" Script

四国めたん「Let's recap BigInt's limitations.」
ずんだもん「We noted that Math functions don't work, decimals are out, JSON can't carry them directly, and performance can be heavy.」
四国めたん「We introduced custom algorithms, stringification, and fixed-point as workarounds.」
ずんだもん「Utility helpers and solid documentation were the keys.」
四国めたん「With a clear view of the constraints, it's easier to decide when to adopt BigInt.」
ずんだもん「Next we'll explore real-world techniques for massive integers!」
四国めたん「Share the limitations and countermeasures with the team.」
ずんだもん「Once you're prepared, there's nothing to fear!」
