Shikoku Metan「Let's learn about the types that can be used with the greater than operator!」
Zundamon「Can we compare various types, not just numbers?」
Shikoku Metan「Yes. It works with comparable types like numbers, strings, and Date objects.」
Zundamon「Strings are compared in dictionary order, right!」
Shikoku Metan「Exactly. 'b' > 'a' returns true.」
Zundamon「Being able to compare Date objects is convenient!」
Shikoku Metan「It's commonly used when determining which date is newer or older.」
Zundamon「It's important to understand that comparison rules differ by type!」
