Zundamon「<= is read as 'less than or equal', right!」
Shikoku Metan「Yes. It returns true when the left side is less than or equal to the right side.」
Zundamon「Both 5 <= 10 and 5 <= 5 return true?」
Shikoku Metan「Exactly. The feature is that it includes the equal case.」
Zundamon「It's commonly used for maximum value checks!」
Shikoku Metan「It's useful for upper limit checks like score caps and inventory verification.」
