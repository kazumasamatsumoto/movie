# #320 "Legacy Code Support"

Shikoku Metan: "Let's learn about strictNullChecks support for legacy code!"
Zundamon: "Non-Null Assertion ! can be used as a temporary measure!"
Shikoku Metan: "That's right. Use it when you can guarantee it's not null/undefined."
Zundamon: "Type assertion as is also convenient as a temporary measure, right?"
Shikoku Metan: "Exactly. However, add TODO comments to fix it later."
Zundamon: "Functions with any type should also be fixed gradually!"
Shikoku Metan: "Yes. Leave TODOs in legacy parts, and write new code strictly."
Zundamon: "While using temporary workarounds, we improve gradually!"

## 📺 Code for Display

```typescript
/** Example 1: Non-Null Assertion (temporary) */
const user = getUser()!; // null/undefinedでないと保証
user.name; // OK

/** Example 2: Type assertion (temporary) */
const data = response as User;
// TODO: 適切なnullチェックに修正

/** Example 3: Gradual fixing */
function legacyFunc(value: any) {
  // TODO: strictNullChecks対応
  return value.toString();
}
```
