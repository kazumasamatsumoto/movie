四国めたん「Let's unpack what `void` means when we say “the value doesn't matter.”」
ずんだもん「What does the `void` type represent?」
四国めたん「It signals that a function doesn't return a value—or that you shouldn't use anything it returns. The value itself carries no meaning.」
ずんだもん「Where do we use it?」
四国めたん「In side-effect functions, event handlers, and callbacks—the work they perform matters, not their return value.」
ずんだもん「I see! Only the side effect counts!」
四国めたん「If you try to use the return value, the compiler complains. That's still true in TypeScript v5.9.」
ずんだもん「Types can enforce the intent—that's awesome!」
