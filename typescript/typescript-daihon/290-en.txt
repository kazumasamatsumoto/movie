四国めたん「Let's learn the difference between `null` and `false`!」
ずんだもん「How are `null` and `false` different?」
四国めたん「`null` signals the absence of a value, while `false` is the boolean false. Their types and meanings differ。」
ずんだもん「Aren't they both falsy?」
四国めたん「They are both falsy, but strict equality `===` distinguishes them. They also behave differently with Nullish Coalescing。」
ずんだもん「I see! So their types are different!」
四国めたん「`strictNullChecks` guarantees type safety—`boolean` can't accept `null`。」
ずんだもん「It's awesome that the type system keeps them clearly separated!」
