四国めたん「Let's learn the conceptual difference between `void` and `undefined`!」
ずんだもん「How are `void` and `undefined` different?」
四国めたん「`void` conveys that the return value is intentionally ignored, while `undefined` conveys that the value `undefined` is returned—they come from different design ideas.」
ずんだもん「What do you mean?」
四国めたん「Put another way, `void` means “we don't care about the return value,” whereas `undefined` means “we return the value `undefined`.” Their purposes diverge.」
ずんだもん「Got it! So it's about intention!」
四国めたん「This distinction exists because of TypeScript's unique type system, and it stays important in TypeScript v5.9.」
ずんだもん「I love that types can express intent!」
