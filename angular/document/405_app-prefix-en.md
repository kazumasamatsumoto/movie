# #405 "app- Prefix"

## Overview
The `app-` prefix is the default prefix generated by Angular CLI, used to avoid selector and component name conflicts.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the role of the `app-` prefix
- Learn how to change the prefix in CLI configuration
- Understand the importance of unifying prefixes as a project policy

## Technical Points
- Can be changed in `angular.json`'s `prefix` setting
- Automatically applied to newly generated directives and components
- Use command option `--prefix` for multiple prefixes

## 📺 On-Screen Code (for video)
```bash
ng g directive shared/loading --prefix=lib --standalone
```

## 💻 Detailed Implementation Example (for learning)
```json
// angular.json (excerpt)
{
  "projects": {
    "app": {
      "prefix": "app"
    }
  }
}
```

```bash
# Change project-wide prefix
ng config projects.app.prefix lib
```

## Best Practices
- Set different prefixes for application and library to avoid conflicts
- Enforce the same rules for files added outside of CLI
- Adopt a unique prefix (e.g., `ngx`) for public libraries

## Considerations
- After changing the prefix, existing code also needs to be renamed
- Manage individual settings for workspaces with multiple projects
- Update documentation and auto-generation scripts when changing naming conventions to maintain consistency
