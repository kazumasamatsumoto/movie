# #307 「Directive vs Component の違い」台本

ずんだもん「I want to clarify the difference between Directives and Components.」
四国めたん「Components are UI units with their own templates and styles, while Directives are thin layers that add behavior to existing DOM.」
ずんだもん「Do they share the same lifecycle?」
四国めたん「They share the main hooks, but Directives have no view, so their change detection cost is lighter.」
ずんだもん「How do we choose between them?」
四国めたん「If it includes UI and layout, pick a Component; if it's about styling or conditional control, choose a Directive.」
ずんだもん「Is migrating between them difficult?」
四国めたん「You can wrap the Directive inside a Component and tidy the template incrementally when needed.」
